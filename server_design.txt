server should be a SINGLE PROCESS

NOTE: server does not have to be Flash Duel specific!!!!!!
Would probably be best to write server code in general and have it pass along messages to the appropriate flash duel thing?

Use 'select', as shown here:

When a client connects, server should ask for
1. name
2. character symbol
3. lobby to join

if lobby is empty, prompt for password
if empty, create lobby with no password

DON'T TRY TO DO SPECTATORS YET

if lobby is full, tell user and ask for new lobby
if lobby has 1 player, connect user to lobby and start game

Server should create a big list of clients.
For each client store which lobby they are connected to

Have server listen for a message from one of the clients
When it finds one, check which lobby they are connected to
process player's input for that game
make the next request for input, then go back to that big loop
